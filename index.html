        TL;DR - Currently rebuilding the game, it is NOT canceled!
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    <span class="puckoff">Puck Off</span> development was paused during 2018 for personal reasons.
    I just got back to the game and felt like it really didn't live up to
    what I wanted the game to be. 
</p>
<p>
    In the beginning <span class="puckoff">Puck Off</span> started as a simple Table-Top hockey game. After that
    it evolved into something different. As development progressed I got more and more locked
    in to what the game had become and I didn't really like it.
</p>
<p>
    So right now I'm rebuilding a few things from scratch, especially the player controls and physics.
    This will enable more flexibility to add and change things as I go along. Hopefully this new foundation 
    will make the game a better experience overall.

    I will update the site when I have something to show. In the meantime, check out my twitter for updates:
