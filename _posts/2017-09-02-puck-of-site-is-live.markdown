One week ago I started playing around with the idea of creating a hockey game. My inspiration mainly old classic table-hockey games. Where I come from (Sweden), almost everyone I knew as a kid had one of these games.

So I decided to start making a prototype, things took of quickly and turned into a fully functional 4-player local multiplayer hockey game!

It's not entirely like the old table-hockey games. But with that and a mix of real hockey I think it turned out really well!

## Current features

* 50+ National Teams (In accordance to IIHF)
* 4-player local multiplayer
* Computer controlled players
* Super cool instant replays
* Hours of fun!
