<p>Pucks, videos, menus, localization</p>

### What has happened since last time?

Not super much in terms of gameplay. Mostly some work with controller support, gamepads and tons of optimizations. Added some nicer menus and now I also have support for localization in terms of text.

I'm going to add English & Swedish first, then I'll look at other languages.

The puck control also got an overhaul, still far from perfect but some hopefully I can start doing some private playtesting soon with some friends so I can get some feedback on that.

I completely remade the menus from scratch and they are a lot nicer now. Might do a technical blog on a specific shader in the menus and how I did automated translations in the UI.

That's it for now, not so much but I'd say it was a pretty good week considering I was sick for two days.

### Video!

I also added the very first gameplay video!
