<p>Beta will be coming soon!</p>

### What has happened since last time?

I took a few days off of work to try and finish the beta this week. A lot of stuff has been fixed already.

Right now menus are in place and a complete rehaul of the color-theme which you can see on this site :)
Minor tweaks have been made as well to make stuff work better.

I reduced the amount of teams to only IIHF World Championship countries. And a few special teams as well (you'll see!)

Current list of teams:

* Belarus
* Canada
* Czech
* Denmark
* Finland
* France
* Germany
* Italy
* Latvia
* Norway
* Russia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* USA

Next up is focusing on the following list and try to get everything into place for the beta.

* Better AI
* Team Skill Level
* Better puck control
* Bugs

See you in the beta!
