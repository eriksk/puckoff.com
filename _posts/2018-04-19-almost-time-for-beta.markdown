<p>Getting ready for the BETA</p>

## What's going on? Where's my <span class="puckoff">PUCK OFF</span>?!

Well, I've been busy with other stuff. But have patience, <span class="puckoff">PUCK OFF</span> will arrive in 2018.
I am going to release a beta, hopefully around summer time. No date yet, but I will send out invites when the time comes.

Next weekend, the <span class="puckoff">PUCK OFF</span> WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP will take place at my work where we have an annual LAN-party.

## News

Just going to leave some notes on a few new features here

* Powerups - 5 so far but more will come!
* New animation system - Much more realistic and super nice looking
* Improved controls - Puck control is much more precise
* Improved AI - AI is now not super dumb, but still kind of dumb...
* General bug fixes

More info to come!
