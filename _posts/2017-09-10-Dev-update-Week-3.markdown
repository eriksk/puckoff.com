<p>What has happened in the first three weeks?</p>

### Background

First of all, I just want to write about why this game is being developed in the first place.

About nine or ten years ago, I discovered a game development competition hosted by Microsoft called Dream.Build.Play. This was when the Xbox 360 was super hot and C# (the programming language) already had gained some traction. The game that had won that time was ["The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai" by James Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dishwasher:_Dead_Samurai)

I read some stuff about how he had made the demo he submitted in around two months and I thought, maybe I can do something like that. And that's how I got into programming.

At the time I was using C# with XNA Game Studio from Microsoft to develop games for the Xbox 360. Of course, my games looked pretty much like garbage at the time and so did the code.

Fast forward about nine or ten years (and probably over 200 unfinished games later) I saw that Dream.Build.Play was coming back! Nostalgia all over the place and I knew, this time I had to enter a game!

So here we are, deadline is 1st of December 2017 and it's closing in. So about two months ago I started working on a first person shooter for the competition. I quickly realized that the game I wanted to build would never be done in time to December. So I figured I'd pause that game for a while and make something that would realisticly meet the deadline.

Fiddling around in Blender (3D modeling software) and making some stuff was pretty much how I got the idea. "What if I just did a table-top hockey game?!". One week later I have a fully functional game :D

So were are we at right now? Three weeks in...

### Tech Stack

First of all here's what I'm using to build the game.

* Engine: Unity3D
* 3D Modeling: Blender
* Texture work: Affinity Pro
* Audio: Audacity & Garage Band
* Code: C#
* OS: Mac & Windows, I alternate for Xbox One builds and mac stuff

As for the competition, I'm also looking into how to use Microsofts different services to make the game better, like Azure, Mixer. At the very least I should have Xbox Live statistics in place.

### Features - So far...

* Hockeymatches - the actual gameplay
* 50+ playable teams! (Currently only national teams)
* Instant replays (I'll probably write a blog about how this works, because it's pretty interesting)
* 1-4 players locally
* 1-8 hockey players in a match including AI players (yes you can play 1 player against no team, but it's pretty boring!)
* Super shots
* Tackles/Crosschecking
* Gamepad support (300+ different gamepads supported on mac & windows)
* Real music - from the artist "A Hall and the Eces'"

### Planned Features

* Custom team creator
* Saved replays
* Replays of full matches
* Keyboard support

### Target platforms

So this we will see about further on...

* Mac
* PC/Windows
* (Maybe linux)
* Xbox One - I develop for it but I have no idea how to actually release a game there

### BETA

I will have a beta for the game, it is going to be private but you can sign up and I'll let you know if you're in it. <a href="/beta">Sign up for BETA</a>
