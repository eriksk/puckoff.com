<p>Long time no progress?</p>

### What has happened since last time?

Well a lot, but not much that I can show right now. Mostly I'm getting things ready for beta testing.
There are quite a few things left to be done before then. But I'm going to try my best to get the beta ready for the first of December!

Things that actually have happened:

* New player model!
* Animations for characters
* Tackling now cause characters to go ragdoll, super funny things can happen now!
* Menus are almost done
* Localization is in place
* Puck control is much much better
* GamePad control is sooo much better
* AI still sucks
* Graphics are improved a lot
* Performance is much better 

Progress it a bit slow at the moment, lots of stuff going on at work etc, but I'm confident that a playable demo will be available for those signed up for Beta on the 1st of December
